## 🧠 Floor 1: What is Networking?

**Date Completed:** April 2025

### 📌 Overview
This room introduced the fundamentals of how networks work, including how devices communicate using IP addresses, ports, and protocols. It set the groundwork for understanding how data moves across the internet and why cybersecurity professionals need to understand these layers.

### 🛠️ What I Did

- Explored DNS and how it translates domain names  
- Reviewed port numbers and how they connect services  
- Identified common protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP  
- Completed short quizzes to test my understanding

### 💡 What I Learned
- The difference between public and private IP addresses  
- Why DNS is crucial to how the internet functions  
- What port numbers are and how they relate to services (e.g., port 80 = HTTP)  
- The basics of TCP/UDP communication  
- Why this knowledge is essential for spotting threats

### 🔍 Tools Used
- TryHackMe’s interactive platform  
- Terminal-based exercises and diagrams  
- Web browser quizzes

### 💬 Reflection
This room helped me feel more confident navigating basic networking topics. I now understand how to interpret the structure of IPs and how protocols operate at a foundational
