## 🧠 Floor 1: What is Networking?

**Date Completed:** April 2025

### 📌 Overview
This room introduced the fundamentals of how networks work, including how devices communicate using IP addresses, ports, and protocols. It set the groundwork for understanding how data moves across the internet and why cybersecurity professionals need to understand these layers.

### 🛠️ What I Did
- Learned how IP addresses identify devices  
- Explored DNS and how it translates domain names  
- Reviewed port numbers and how they connect services  
- Identified common protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP  
- Completed short quizzes to test my understanding

### 💡 What I Learned
- The difference between public and private IP addresses  
- Why DNS is crucial to how the internet functions  
- What port numbers are and how they relate to services (e.g., port 80 = HTTP)  
- The basics of TCP/UDP communication  
- Why this knowledge is essential for spotting threats

### 🔍 Tools Used
- TryHackMe’s interactive platform  
- Terminal-based exercises and diagrams  
- Web browser quizzes

### 💬 Reflection
This room helped me feel more confident navigating basic networking topics. I now understand how to interpret the structure of IPs and how protocols operate at a foundational

My TryHackMe room writeups as I learn cybersecurity.

🛡️ Floor 2: Offensive Security Intro
Date Completed: April 2025

📌 Overview
This room introduced the basics of offensive security—how ethical hackers think, how attacks are performed, and why offensive security is used to find and fix vulnerabilities before bad actors can exploit them.

🛠️ What I Did
Learned the steps of the cyber attack lifecycle (recon, scanning, gaining access)

Reviewed common tools used in offensive security

Studied real-world attack scenarios

Answered scenario-based questions about pentesting

💡 What I Learned
Offensive security is about thinking like a hacker to better defend systems

Key tools include: Nmap (for scanning), Burp Suite, Metasploit, etc.

The importance of reconnaissance before launching an attack

Difference between black hat, gray hat, and white hat hackers

Why ethical hacking is essential to modern cybersecurity

🔍 Tools Explored
Nmap (brief intro)

Burp Suite (mentioned)

Metasploit Framework (mentioned)

Web browsers + search engines for recon

💬 Reflection
This room helped me understand how attackers approach networks, and why that mindset is crucial to building defense strategies. It made me curious to learn more about penetration testing, CTFs, and red team vs. blue team roles. I’m excited to try hands-on labs in future rooms.

🛡️ Floor 3: Defensive Security Intro
Date Completed: April 2025

📌 Overview
This room introduced the basics of defensive security—how cybersecurity professionals monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real time. I learned how blue teamers protect networks by setting up defenses, analyzing logs, and responding to incidents.

🛠️ What I Did
Learned about the structure and role of a SOC (Security Operations Center)

Explored different types of security tools used in defensive security

Identified log sources and how they’re used to spot suspicious activity

Reviewed common threat detection strategies and real-life attack responses

💡 What I Learned
The blue team’s job is to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats

Tools like SIEMs, firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems are used daily

Logs from endpoints, networks, and servers are crucial for monitoring

Incident response includes preparation, identification, containment, and recovery

Strong communication and documentation are key to successful defense

🔍 Tools Discussed
SIEM platforms (like Splunk and ELK Stack)

Firewalls and IDS/IPS tools

Log analyzers and threat intel platforms

💬 Reflection
This room helped me understand what it’s really like to work in a SOC. I’m more interested than ever in blue teaming and can see myself in a role that involves log analysis, alert triage, and helping secure real networks. It made cybersecurity feel even more real.
